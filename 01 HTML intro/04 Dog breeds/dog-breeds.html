      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a> is an
      excellent breed for owners with nearby neighbors or thin walls. They’re a
      popular choice for apartment dwellers because they are generally calm and
      quiet pets. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a>s
      are not talkative and they rarely bark unless there is a good reason to do
      so. These dogs reach a height of 18 inches or more and often reach a
      weight of more than 25 pounds. They’re a medium sized dog, but don’t
      require a lot of living space. To keep your
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a> in good health
      and well toned, take him on a daily walk. The exersise will be good for
      both of you and it will give you some alone time together to bond.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a>s love to
      please their owners so house training and leash training shouldn’t be a
      problem if you use positive reinforcement methods and are consistent.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a>’s are minimal
      shedders so there won’t be a lot of additional cleanup. A weekly grooming
      is all that your
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a> will need.

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bichon_Fris%C3%A9">Bichon Frise</a>
      are a small breed of dog that do not reach heights of more than 12 inches.
      They, like the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji">Basenji</a> do not shed
      much and only need to be brushed once or twice a week to keep the coat in
      good condition. These dogs are energetic and they do need to have one to
      two walks per day, but they are relatively easy to train for walking on a
      leash.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bichon_Fris%C3%A9">Bichon Frise</a>
      are a good choice for people who have allergies because of the low
      shedding. They are quiet dogs who don’t usually bark unless they are
      frightened, terribly excited or need something from you.

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Terrier">Boston Terrier</a>s
      are handsome little dogs who usually reach a height of 18 inches or less.
      Males are generally on the taller side and females are smaller in size.
      What makes
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Terrier">Boston Terrier</a>s
      such a popular choice for city living is their small size and affectionate
      personalities. They shed only slightly, and with a weekly grooming, you’ll
      discover that the shedding is ot a big deal. These dogs are known to be
      little gentlemen and are easily trained to be well behaved house pets with
      a gentle disposition. This makes them a good choice for families who have
      children. The one potential drawback is that
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Terrier">Boston Terrier</a>s
      tend to have high energy levels. You can offset this by establishing a
      regular walking time each day. These dogs do well in leash training and
      most are easy to house train for toileting. They are wonderful companions
      who love snuggling and love.

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund">Dachshund</a>s are hound
      dogs, but they are the smallest variety. These dogs are easy to identify
      because all you need to do is look for a pup that is shaped like a hot
      dog. They are often referred to as “weiner dogs.” They are friendly little
      dogs with a long body and tiny short legs. They are usually cheerful and
      friendly pets who love to play and put on a show. If you prefer a dog who
      is a character, then a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund">Dachshund</a> may be
      your best bet. Their coats need minimal care and they are easy to train.
      This intelligent dog loves to learn new tricks. They don’t need a lot of
      exercise so you can either choose to walk them outdoors on a leash, or let
      them get their exercise indoors. On a side note,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund">Dachshund</a>s are
      amazing competitors. They love to race against other dogs in competitions.
      You may find other Daschund owners at the dog park who have trained their
      pups to do some very interesting tricks.

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_Pinscher"
        >Miniature Pinscher</a
      >s strongly resemble a full sized doberman, but in a smaller version. Your
      friends and neighbors may actually think that you have a Dobie pup when
      he’s full grown if you don’t tell them otherwise. This breed is a popular
      choice for apartment or small home living because they are small in size
      and adapt well to smaller living spaces. When properly socialized from an
      early age, the Mini Pinscher can be a good house pet. They are not
      necessarily the best option for homes with small children. They are great
      watchdogs because they are suspicious of strangers. This dog isn’t a heavy
      barker, but will let you known if a stranger is nearby.
