    <h1 id="step-1">History</h1>

    <p class="step-2">
      For many years, there was a legend that Golden Retrievers were descended
      from Russian sheepdogs bought from a circus. In fact, the breed was
      developed in Scotland, at the highland estate of Sir Dudley Majoribanks,
      later known as Lord Tweedmouth.
    </p>

    <p class="step-3">
      Tweedmouth, like many gentry of his day, bred animals of all kinds, trying
      to perfect different breeds. Tweedmouth's breeding records from 1835 to
      1890 show what he was aiming for with the
      <span>Golden: A talented retriever</span> — Tweedmouth was an ardent
      waterfowl hunter — with a superb nose, who would be more attentive to his
      human hunting companion than the setters and spaniels used at the time for
      retrieving. He also wanted the dog to be loyal and even-tempered in the
      home.
    </p>

    <p id="step-4">
      Tweedmouth took Nous home to Scotland, and in 1868 and 1871, bred him to
      Belle, a Tweed Water Spaniel. Tweed Water Spaniels (now extinct) were
      known for being eager retrievers in the hunting field, and exceptionally
      <span>calm and loyal</span> in the home — characteristics you'll find in
      today's Golden Retrievers.
    </p>

    <p class="step-5">
      Nousand Belle's descendants were bred with Wavy- and Flat-coated
      retrievers, another Tweed Water Spaniel, and a red setter. Tweedmouth kept
      mostly the yellow puppies to continue his breeding program, and gave
      others away to friends and relatives.
    </p>

    <p id="step-6">
      Not surprisingly, Tweedmouth's breed first attracted attention for their
      skills in the hunting field. One of the most well-known was Don of Gerwyn,
      <span>a liver-coated descendent</span> of one of Tweedmouth's dogs, who
      won the International Gundog League trial in 1904.
